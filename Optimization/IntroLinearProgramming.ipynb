    "A power plant burns coal, oil, and gas to generate electricity. Suppose that each ton of coal generates 600 kilowatt-hours, emits 20 units of sulfur dioxide, and 15 units of suspended particles, and costs $200; each ton of oil generates 550 kilowatt-hours, emits 18 units of sulfur dioxide, and 12 units of suspended particles, and costs $220; each ton of gas generates 500 kilowatt-hours, emits 15 units of sulfur dioxide, and 10 units of suspended particles, and costs $250. The Environmental Protection Agency restricts daily sulfur dioxide emissions to no more than 60 units and suspended particle emissions to no more than 75 units. If the power plant does not want to spend more than $2,000 per day on fuel, how much fuel of each type should it buy to maximize the amount of energy generated?\n",
